"Hi Rohan,

I just wanted to take a moment to express how much I respect and admire you as a YouTuber. Your content consistently stands out for its quality, insight, and the effort you put into it. Whether it‚Äôs your breakdowns, commentary, or analysis, it‚Äôs evident that you approach your work with a deep passion and understanding of the craft.

One thing I‚Äôve always appreciated about your channel is how authentic you are. You don‚Äôt just follow trends‚Äîyou carve your own path and stay true to your opinions, even when it might not be the most popular thing to do. That‚Äôs rare in a space where people often compromise their integrity for views, and it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs earned you my respect.

You‚Äôve also managed to build a community that feels genuine and supportive, which speaks volumes about the kind of person you are. Your humility and ability to connect with your audience make your content not just entertaining but meaningful.

Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing because it‚Äôs inspiring to see someone so passionate and talented thrive in their element. Thank you for giving us such valuable and engaging content‚ÄîI genuinely look forward to everything you put out!

Wishing you all the success and positivity in the world.

Best regards,
Nemesis",26

I like your honesty,1
"I feel this ep is an experimental project...songs like duniya naraz, nazare, revontulet and safar are kind of experimental... in which I feel only duniya naraz was not up to the mark... rest of them has good melody with good composition, and also their hook are groovy and catchy on the other hand duniya naraz takes time to built itself... where I feel it lag to connect many people
and i feel people who doesn't like this ep might not have this type of taste in music",3
