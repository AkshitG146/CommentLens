"Kotaro: *jumps into the ocean*

Ocean: you may have this back"
3:24 Congratulations Kotaro you are now officially the second moana
"1:17
Th-The ocean's not scary at all! See, Kotaro?
Kotaro: T R A U M A"
"Kotaro saying ""nii-chan"" is the best thing that has ever happened to me ;-;"
"Ryu: ocean is not scary kotaro

*almost drowned*"
"3:23
Ocean: Here, I just can't take something so cute"
"Kotaro: sees ocean
Kotaro: I don’t know about this chief."
Sometimes I forget kotaro is actually a baby and not just a cute tiny adult reborn I blame you for this
"Baby dives into the ocean for his brother because baby doesn’t understand he just went under water-

Me: crying from wholesomeness*"
I busted laughing at seeing the vid start with two kids crying in the ocean while the other has this blank stare on his face
As a kindergarten teacher.. 0:07 is the most accurate thing I've ever seen in my entire life..
"The fact that Kotaro indeed remembers is what gets to me. I think despite being a toddler, he has a sense that his parents are gone and understands it… it’s sad honestly."
"Kotaro:*jumps into ocean* Nii-chan!!!!
Sea:*reject him*
Lol I really really hope they make season 2 for this anime"
"3:14
kotaro: oh my f*king god, he is f*king dead"
I can't believe I'm really crying for Kotaro. He's gonna be the reason i watch this show
"3:24 Poseidon: I think you dropped this.

Edit: I'm crying at now at my own comment.   X''D

Edit #2: I did not even realize the amount of people who liked this. Thank you all so very much. All of you are awesome people."
"I love how Hayato's mom smacks his head saying, ""What would he do with seaweed?"""
"Ryuchi: see? It’s all goo-

*proceeds to drown*


edit: yo tf"
0:45 bruh Takuma out here being able to break corn in half at a young age and even I can't break corn in half-
I REALLY NEED TO SEE THEM GROWING UPI HAVE TO
This anime takes a tough topic and makes a wholesome story out of it. It is cute as heck but sad as hell.
Wave: Time to wash you human!
"正直、このアニメ見た時癒されて癒されて本当に疲れが取れたよね!!
この子ら天使かな"
"1:49 Plss Kamitani bribing Kotaro for forgiveness by giving him seaweed
This is too cute for my poor heart to handle "
何？穴が埋まった？じゃもう一回掘りなさいが好き
Kotaro freaking out and thinking his brother might be gone forever punches me in the soul every time.
Someone put a medal on this cute brave baby for trying to save his brother️
It's all fun and games until you remember what happened to their parents-
"3:48 Lady: he got upset

3:15 Me: you sure? He looks horrified to me"
"Ryu: *almost dies*
The kids: LAMEEE"
こたろうのにーちゃん呼びが可愛すぎて何回も巻き戻してる可愛い
"「え？穴が埋まった？」
「じゃ、また掘りなさい」は草"
"3:11 Kotaro: Nii-chan
Me: so cute TvT WHY IS THIS ANIME SO CUTE"
"Nobody:

Not a single thing:

Not a living soul:

Me:

 "
"虎太郎にとって、お兄ちゃんは大事だもんね
お兄ちゃんにとって虎太郎は大事だもんね"
I think all older siblings can understand that feeling when your siblings don’t trust you nearly as much as they trust your parents..
3:16 the ocean ate my brother
何？穴が埋まった？じゃあもっかい掘りなさいがツボwww
"Ryu: coughing

Kotaro: traumatized"
このアニメはほんま子どもが欲しくなるアニメだぜ…
水着一緒に選んでくれる先生とか好きすぎる
"Kotaro: Dives in the ocean to save brother

My brother: throws me in the lake"
Kotaro crying is one of the most cutest yet saddest things I've ever seen in my life.
"0:02 
Everyone: screaming and crying

0:09

Midori : "
I never thought I would cry so much from watching a supposedly lighthearted sweet anime. I WASN’T EXPECTING THIS WHEN I CAME HERE TRYING TO LIFT MY SPIRIT AND HEAL MY SOUL
0:07 Armin Eren and Mikasa in the last episode XD
"Underaged kids... 

But it’s all cute.

We’re good here!"
Kamitani giving Kotaro seaweed because he made the baby spill his drink is so darn cute. I love Kamitani
I just noticed that when anime people go out swimming in the ocean without sunscreen and they dont get sun burn (howw is this posssibel!!!!)
1:52この母親からこの息子が・・・納得。
"Kotaro: dives

Ocean: This baby is too damn cute alright you can have this back"
3:31 ここ1話の虎太郎が熱出した時の事思い出す…
"Me: A video can’t make you cry and smile at the same time.

YouTube recommendations:"
"I never thought you could capture the death of childhood innocence, fear and trauma before but Kotaro is here to prove me wrong"
なんだこの可愛いアニメは
"All the baby's:crying
Kotaro: don't cry your strong"
"Honestly, the moms were so sweet for getting her a swimsuit. Buying one at the beach is crazy expensive, but they wanted her to enjoy herself and look cute "
今気づいたけど、潜った時に貝拾ったのか
2:19 寝ている兎田さんの顔に隼が持ってきたワカメが被ってるの草
"Kotaro: Wants to help his brother

Also Kotaro: I know what I have to do, but I don’t know if I have the strength to do it."
1:00 is so cute even tho he is crying
when kotaro was crying a tear formed in my eye ( i’m sorry i just really love him he’s so cute)
Kotaro he rarely cries he cried in the first episode when he got sick and this episode was just too wholesome 
3:24 ここめっちゃ鼻に水入ったやろ
これを見るとやっぱり泣きそうになってしまう...
I swear the fact that Kotaro tried to save his brother even though he was scared to death his poor little heart would probably skip one to many beats it's so sweet all for his big brother Kotaro is to cute for his own good like all of them are especially the twins who can't live without each other 
海見て、泣いてる赤ちゃん可愛すぎる。٩(๑´3｀๑)۶
この海の話、漫画で見た時号泣したな…怖い海でも、大好きなお兄ちゃんの為なら、コタローは勇者になれる。
"0:11 
midori-chan really loves the ocean XD
midori-chan is the baby on the pink swimsuit"
"こたろう‥この可愛さ、マジ破壊力の半端なさ！
両親のシーンすきだなぁ"
3:30 Kotaro's crying broke my heart
3:15 this face shows just how much he was scared that his brother would die and never come back like their parents...
2期、来ないかな～
"2:14  虎太郎に日が当たらないように暑いけど、影になってあげてる竜ちゃん優しい。
ほんとに弟思いだね"
"It's one of the cutest, cutest, and most adorable anime I've ever seen. The babies they take care of there are very, very cute"
"kotaro: * litterally doing nothing *
ocean: So you have chosen, death."
1:08 had that EXACT moment with my little sister. I held her close and a wave swooped us. I had to force my body to the floor so she couldn’t get hurt
"When the ocean sent kotaro back. 
It was too amazing. 
Kotaro and all babies are extremely cute "
"Kotaro: *Goes into the wave-*
The ocean: No you precious child, I want to protect you here. A child peed in the on me and I don't want to get you infected- *Lifts Kotaro up to the beach-*"
I Cannot Explain To Yhu How Cute That Thumbnail Is...
"This show makes me wanna cry because of all the cuteness  I love the characters so much, especially the adorable babies"
Very very cute

0:25の女の人の声が桜蘭高校ホスト部のハニー先輩に聞こえる
It's adorable how kotaro doesn't cries or runs from the the water his face says it all 
4:11 I guess Kotaro got his dad's looks and Ryu got his mum's.
Poor bean knows he only has his brother now since his parents died awwwww
"1:57 Arms swinging So cute!
2:17 Thats really cute!"
ロリコンショタコンになるアニメ…
Aside from Karakai Jozou Anime. I would really be glad if Gakuen Babysitter gets a Second season too because of how awesome the manga really is and of course this Anime adaptation is no exception. Just looks at those cute babies specially Kotaro he is so damn cute. 
his whimpers make my heart sad  3:54

Water: hahahaha drown here i come"
"Ryu : Ïts not that scary koraro
Kortaro : Jumps into water

Ryu: N.o.t that scary "
I love how the two kids are horrified while Kotaro has excepted death
"1:33 
Kuzu and taku kun: bIG moUnTAin bIG moUnTAin"
"This is probably a bit depressing, but I'm feeling melancholic from watching this.

Years ago, I wanted children of my own. I wanted to raise a son and a daughter, to be bright and wonderful people that would bring joy into the world.

I grew older, and I became bitter. I know now that I would not make a good parent or partner.

If you feel in your heart that you want to raise a child, and you have the means to do so (that is, a stable home and income), then do it. The window to be a parent is different for each person, but when it latches shut, it can never be opened again. There is love, real, unequivocal love, in raising a child. That love is a truly amazing thing."
"When Kotaro cried it melts my heart 
He love his brother so much  i want to have a brother like him "
"A lot of people think it's annoying for babies to cry. I think it's cute, especially since I'll miss it once they grow up."
Kotaro is literally the cutest thing ever.
"3:00 How to look aftet a children:
Just let them go into the ocean and let the wave bring them back. Nice :v"
1:07 Inconveniently large wave coming through!
"1:34 two brothers playing the sand, what's more wholesome than this?"
"My Heart can't hold this cuteness (crying rainbows :, (((:, (((:, ((()"
"I give this show props for actually making little kids annoying in anime. Most of the time they are sweet but these guys actually kind of made it more like real life. Loud, cry a lot, demand attention and can be pretty annoying"
"Kotaro: jumps in water

Ocean: DO A FLIP!!"
"Do brothers like Ryu exist? He's so sweet, kind and caring. Kotaro is too adorable."
It makes me teary eyed when Kotaro cried. He's afraid to lost his nii-chan!
"No matter what the anime is, there will always be a beach episode."
This anime really is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
I will protect this precious little one
お兄ちゃん優しすぎ
1:46  kotaro~~
Why is this anime so innocent huh?! HuUH?! EXPLAIN YOURSELF AUTHOR-SENPAI!!! wipes off tear
Kotaro:Water Breathing….Eleventh Form:Dead Calm
3:15 kotaro looks like he said you die when I say you die
2:22 takuma and kazuma are holding hands when they sleep
i love how the ocean just gave kotaro back when he tried to go to his brother
I love how half the kids are having fun while the other half is losing their minds
Kotaro is more protective of his brother than my brother when I almost die.
"i love the friendship Kamitami provides for Ryu, and i love Usaisa san.  
The world of this anime is so dreamy, everyone is so kind and lovely. "
いやーん可愛すぎるよ
"“Ryu was drowning! So lame!”
 "
"1:24 
Taka:Ryu's Drowning Lame!
Takuma:So Lame!
Me:Nothings lame here kids.."
I think Kotaro is afraid of ocean due to his memories of his parents
WHYY R THOSE LITTLE THINGS CALLED BABIES SO DAMN CUUUUTTTEEEE?!?!??!?!??!?!
"Kotaro: Jumps into the ocean

Ocean: I'm gonna stop you right there"
Kamitani is purely jealous!!!!!! Yasssssss
That ending was surprisingly heart warming.

"I can not NOT cry for these wholesomeness. And I automatically smile whenever the toddlers are smiling/laughing. Uuuhhh gemeeeesss ️ I'm so happy when it got animated, I read the manga first and love it already. The animation is just PERFECT CUTENESS."
Kotaro is so mellow and sweet.
My heart aches so much with happiness
"0:57 
Usaida:the ocean isn’t bad

I believe in Kotaro supremacy

the wave that brought back kotaro is givin me moana vibes 
"Dude, the final, i almost cried, it's so pure"
二期があると見たい。ちょっと期待したいです。
Kazuma’s face is adorable!  (1:11)

"I love this, even when I skip episodes I don’t even care."
"Bruh, my adorable niece had the same reaction when we tried to put here in the water. We were at a water park though and she was just crying so she ended up taking a nap on her nana the entire time instead."
"my god i have this EXACT memory w my own mum when I was 2. I rarely ever cried as a baby, was as chill and dead-fish eyed as kotaro, but when my mum dipped into the water to peekaboo me and didn't come up right away, I cried so much I actually remember it as an adult hahaha. Water is so terrifying."
"1:17
This is how Kotaro’s phobia of the water started.


















Lol"
Kotaro is cute 
"it’s so scary when kids that doesn’t really cry, cry. i’d be like OH SHEET WHAT HAPPENED NO"
こたろうが泣く度にこっちも毎回もらい泣きしてしまう
"Dude, you can make these! How crazy is that!"
"If all of you are wondering why Kotaro jumped in the ocean, there were actually 2 reasons why, the first one was mentioned by Midori-chan's Mother, and the second one was their parent's death, Kotaro was afraid to lose his Big Brother which was the only thing he had left."
Kotaro is just so unbothered while 2 of the other kids are screaming

"Sometime's Kotaro is so annoing (in my opinion) I mean Like he's so cute, but Nii-chan cant even go in the water with he's friends, cuz Kotaro apears and start to cry just because Nii-chan is with he's friends in the water, i understand that he's only a Little child, but I saw a scene where Nii-chan was in he's classroom and then Kotaro apears again just for a ""hug""
Im not saying that he's not cute, im saying that Kotaro is annoing, and the other Kids are annoing too"
